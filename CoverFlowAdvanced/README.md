Cover Flow
==========

![Cover Flow preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/araid/Processing-Examples/master/CoverFlow/coverflow_preview.jpg)

Advanced version. Demonstrates:
* Loading all images in one folder without knowing their names.
* Lazy loading and unloading of images in the background so that the main drawing thread is not blocked.

To run it download a good number of high resolution images and place them in the data/covers folder. I used this one http://snippets.khromov.se/stock-photo-archive-zip-77-images/

And download and install the following libraries:

* [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) for the user interface elements.
* [Ani](http://www.looksgood.de/libraries/Ani/) for animation tweens.
